## Content 
#### I chose to write about hospital health care. I knew getting into this imporatnt topic would be a hard one. But I choose to do my freedom project on hospital health care because I want to be a pediatrian, knowing that you can someday help those around you is an honor.Helping others and putting them first than yourself is something I never struggled with.That is the same reason why my second and third options where mental health care and education management.I want to main my freedom project on careers that I want to do in the future and topics that fit my personality(caring and kind).
