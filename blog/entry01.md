#### I chose to write about hospital health care. I knew getting into this imporatnt topic would be a hard one. But I choose to do my freedom project on hospital health care because I want to be a pediatrian, knowing that you can someday help those around you is an honor.Helping others and putting them first than yourself is something I never struggled with.That is the same reason why my second and third options where mental health care and education management.I want to main my freedom project on careers that I want to do in the future and topics that fit my personality(caring and kind).

#### Searching about hospital health care wasn't something hard.It seemed like the topic itself needed losts of help with developments. When reading about my article [link](https://retinalscreenings.com/blog/top-benefits-of-technology-in-healthcare/#:~:text=Electronic%20recordkeeping%20reduces%20many%20of,and%20assist%20with%20imaging%20analysis.) 

## Engineering Design Process 
#### In the processes of my project I mainly focused on brainstorming, coming up with goods way to explain how coding and technology could help and develope better ways to improving hospital health care.I learned that technology is needed in evey ascpect of Health care and makes it easier for people to find things that can led to cures.Using databased can lead to clear results but sometimes they led to unclear results too that aren't as backed up. These databases include patient records and diagnostics. This has a great impact on a persons behaviors and what meets their needes.
