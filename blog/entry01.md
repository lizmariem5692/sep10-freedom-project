# Entry 1
## Content 
#### I chose to write about hospital health care. I knew getting into this imporatnt topic would be a hard one. But I choose to do my freedom project on hospital health care because I want to be a pediatrian, knowing that you can someday help those around you is an honor.Helping others and putting them first than yourself is something I never struggled with.That is the same reason why my second and third options where mental health care and education management.I want to main my freedom project on careers that I want to do in the future and topics that fit my personality(caring and kind).

## Sources
#### Searching about hospital health care wasn't something hard.It seemed like the topic itself needed losts of help with developments. When reading about my article [link](https://retinalscreenings.com/blog/top-benefits-of-technology-in-healthcare/#:~:text=Electronic%20recordkeeping%20reduces%20many%20of,and%20assist%20with%20imaging%20analysis.) I found examples on the benifits of technology in health care.I did struggle in some aspects, I struggled to find a good website that could give me the right problems that I could see needed to be benifited. The [link](https://hbr.org/2021/12/5-critical-priorities-for-the-u-s-health-care-system) that I found that gave me the right answer had to be exact written articles. I had to make sure that I was asking the problem correctly. In order to find out if the article [link](https://innovaccer.com/resources/blogs/five-ways-poor-data-quality-negatively-impacts-healthcare) was answering the question I asked exactly how database(or other things that needed help) have negative impacts on health. 

## Engineering Design Process 
#### In the processes of my project I mainly focused on brainstorming, coming up with goods way to explain how coding and technology could help and develope better ways to improving hospital health care.I learned that technology is needed in evey ascpect of Health care and makes it easier for people to find things that can led to cures.Using databased can lead to clear results but sometimes they led to unclear results too that aren't as backed up. These databases include patient records and diagnostics. This has a great impact on a persons behaviors and what meets their needes. People would also like to know that the technology or the resources their doctors are using are working well and will give them what they are look for. No one wants to leave a hopital with no answers to what is going on with them. I should Know I went through something similar. Its awful to know that you can't find what the problem is to your body and that is where technology comes in. 



## Skills 
#### A skill I picked up while doing this assignment was problem decomposition,also known as breaking down task into smaller pieces. This helped to tackle down each part of the assignment little by little. I was able to explain everything a bit better without trying to tackle eveything at once.If I did tackle it all at once then I would stress myself out and get all confused, which I tried to aviod.I also tried to pay attention to details, I re-read my paragraphs and checked for spelling mistakes.I read each paragraph about more then twice and I still pray that I have no mistakes.These where my main two skills I picked up.
