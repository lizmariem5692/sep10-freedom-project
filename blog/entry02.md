#### The information and what I learned about Hospital Health Care was something very imporatnt and benifical to humans and their health. In this  [website](https://builtin.com/healthcare-technology) I found information on IT tools and software design that helps in hospital technology. On how it benifits us and what it needs inprovement with.Talks about how tech tools have had improvements in errors like diagnosis and diseases.How its benifical to staff and patients with health insurance and those undergoing surgery.This information is all positive information on hospital health care but there are some problems to the technology. The problems are found on this  [website](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-5-technology-problems-healthcare-agilethought#:~:text=In%20Conclusion,infrastructure%2C%20and%20security%20and%20privacy) which explains the current tech problems.The problems in data,billing patients,security,and infrastructure can benifit a patients resultes. If the data isn't calculated right then that can influence the way a person can handle themselves. For example what if you have high sugar and the results say you have low sugar a person would find themselved adding more sugar to their bodies when they really need to lower that amount of sugar they consume.Now in this [website](https://hbr.org/2006/05/why-innovation-in-health-care-is-so-hard) it talkes more about the improvements and what is needed help in.The ideas on what can help tech tools and improve them, for example states Harvard Business Review:"And IT innovations that connect the many islands of information in the healthcare system can both vastly improve quality and lower costs , for example, keeping a patient’s various providers informed and thereby reducing errors of omission or commission.” A great problem talked about in this website as well as in the one before it, results and the incorrect information can really impact the health of a person.
